    <p>NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), to give the US
        space development effort a distinctly civilian orientation, emphasizing peaceful applications in space
        science. Since its establishment, most American space exploration efforts have been led by NASA,
        including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. NASA is
        supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion spacecraft, the Space
        Launch System, Commercial Crew vehicles, and the planned Lunar Gateway space station. The agency is also
        responsible for the Launch Services Program, which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown
        management for uncrewed NASA launches</p>
